# weather-dashboard

For the project, I was asked to make a webpage, using a Weather API that allows me to connect to its API and thus pull information to display the current and potential weather. To make this work, I would fetch the data, console log that and store it within the local storage, and then parse it so that its readable and call each of them by the object that I want, such as temp, wind, humility. After that, there was another function that calls on the the weather for the forecast of the 5 days. Within this one, I realize it was easier to just make the HTML via Javascript, so thats what I did for each one. I had 2 different functions beacuse it was easier that way, so the API was called 2 differnet times. Then there was an icon function and color function that would set the correct icons to the weather description of either Sunny, Rainy, or Cloudy, and then the correct colors to them, being Orange, Blue and Gray respectively. Then they would be called at the very end, with the user either pushing "enter" or clicking search. If nothing was inside, it would output an alert telling the user to input a city.
